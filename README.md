## Ozdatasets
Welcome to Ozdatasets! 

This repository was compiled at the rOpenSci OzUnconf19 @ University of Sydney, December 2019. 

Its purpose is to document datasets previously created at OzUnconf events, as well as other interesting and unique Australian datasets and resources. We have made our best attempt to have these links/packages functioning. However, in the case of errors still existing, an issue has been logged on Github. 


## Package author notes
All data links and packages are working as of 13/12/19, unless specified.
